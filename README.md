```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

Once modules installations finish you can start develpoment proccess by executing:

```
yarn dev
```
or
```
npm run dev
```

You can execute storybook in a second terminal

```

## The Challenge
The following [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6Lqq3DipyAvKRaXzHqm7os/gigaclear-frontend-challenge?node-id=0%3A1 "Figma") layout needs to be developed using Next.js based on the project skeleton we have provided.

Please consider the Figma as a prototype; we would also like to see your ability to propose improvements, features and new contributions to the product's UI!ðŸ’„

These could include:
- Adding new functionalities
- Creating animations
- Developing visual optimizations

If you decide to do so, please let us know what changes you are proposing to introduce alongside the submission.

## Using the project skeleton
Alongside this README is a project skeleton from which to build your submission.

It is adapted from a standard Next.js template, with some additional contents to get you started (see the `src/components` folder). It also includes a Storybook extension (https://storybook.js.org).

To run this project, run

`yarn`

to install the dependencies, then 

`yarn dev`

to spin up the application and

`yarn storybook`

from a separate terminal to spin up the storybook.

## About the API
To mock the API, you can create a JSON file with the data you will need. You could for instance assume that the content is coming from a headless CMS such as Strapi.

## About the project
You **SHOULD** develop:
- A page with all post cards sorted by post date
- Dynamic navigation when clicking on post cards

If you have additional time, you **COULD** develop:
- Tests
- Documentation of your components on Storybook

## Sending
After finishing the challenge, please upload your submission to a GitHub repository; the person in charge of recruitment will let you know who to share it with.
